OS Assignment 2

To compile:
	$make runsim
	$make testsim

	THERE WILL BE WARNINGS. I was going to try to fix them, but I ran out of time. Try to ignore them pls

To run:
	$./runsim [int] <[testfile]
		int: number of 'licenses' you would like to allow. Defaults to 10.
		you must include the < and a file name with testing data, there is no default

Running will take some time because of the time between writing to log file. for the testing.data file I am including it might take a minute or two. You can cntrl-C and check the partial results in the logfile if you don't feel like waiting the whole time.

FOR TESTING:
	I assume that your testing files will be in the same format as the example so I hard coded "./" to each call for testsim
